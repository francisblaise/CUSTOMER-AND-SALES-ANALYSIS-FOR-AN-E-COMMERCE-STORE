Product Trends:

Denim is the best selling and highest revenue generating product, with (527) and ($52,399) in revenue.

Blue collared products performed best, generating ($158,220), indicating a possible colour preference among shoppers

Geographic Insights:

South Australia leads both in customer count (139) and revenue ($147,816), making it a key market for growth and retention strategies.
Port Hannahburgh generated the highest revenue per city ($7,632) with very few customers, indicating the presence of high spending individuals
Tasmania has the lowest customer count (104) and revenue, which may indicate a need for targeted promotions or better local outreach.

Sales and Order Behaviour:

Monthly revenue growth was mostly negative, except in March, June, July. This highlights need for more consistent revenue driven activities.
Delivery times were relative constant across products, with shirts having the shortest delivery window, offering a possible competitive advantage in fulfilment.


**Recommendations**

Improve Revenue Stability:

Replicate whatever strategies led to the March revenue spike (38.16%) review campaign timing, product launches, promotions, or external events. 
Plan monthly campaigns to reduce revenue volatility consider bundling, flash sales, or seasonal drops. 
Use A/B testing to determine which promotions or offers drive higher conversion rates. 

Boost Customer Retention:

Identify and reward repeat customers with loyalty programs, exclusive access, or discounts. 
Use email marketing to re-engage Gen Z and one-time shoppers, tailoring content to their preferences and behaviours. 

Product Strategy Optimization:

Reevaluate pricing strategy for high volume but low revenue products like Joggers. Raise prices slightly or reduce discount frequency. 
Prioritize stock and marketing for top selling products (Denim, Casual Slim Fit) and popular sizes (Medium, Extra Small). 
Experiment with limited edition colour variations, leveraging the popularity of blue. 

Geographic & Demographic Expansion: 

Focus acquisition and upselling efforts in South Australia, the most lucrative region. 
Introduce region specific campaigns in underperforming states like Tasmania to grow market share. 
Launch targeted ads for Boomers, the most profitable demographic, while creating more relatable branding and social content for Gen Z. 

Enhance Product Delivery Efficiency: 

Since shirts already have shorter delivery times, highlight this in product descriptions as a unique selling point. 
Review logistics data for potential improvements in product lines with longer delivery windows.

### CONCLUSION

This 10-month sales analysis reveals a promising e-commerce operation with over $1 million in revenue, driven largely by Boomer customers, female buyers, and top performing products like Denim and Casual Slim Fit. However, the business faces key challenges in revenue consistency, underperforming segments, and regional disparity. With a data informed strategy that focuses on:

Retaining high value customers

Reactivating low engagement segments

Optimizing product pricing and promotions and 

Replicating peak performance patterns, the store can improve its growth trajectory, customer satisfaction, and profitability.
